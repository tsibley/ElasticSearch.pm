0.63    2013-02-12
        Removed unsupported params from mlt()

0.62    2013-01-03

0.60    2012-11-07
        ENHANCEMENT:
        Added a max_content_length attribute to ElasticSearch::Transport
        to avoid posting too large a body to elasticsearch. The value
        is auto-detected in versions 0.19.12 onwards.
        Added doc param to update()

0.59    2012-10-31

        Errors now have string comparison overloaded

0.58    2012-08-09
        Added a _method_name parameter to reindex() so that objects other
        than ScrolledSearch can be passed as the $source.  The scrolling
        defaults to $source->next, but with $method_name will be called
        as $source->$method_name.

0.57    2012-07-31
        Minor changes to ElasticSearch::TestServer to make it work consistently
        on Travis CI

0.56    2012-07-31
        BUG FIXES
         - Trying to bulk create a doc that already exists should also trigger
           a conflict error, not a general error.

           missing
         - Worked around bug https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2072
           in ES which causes the default HTTP backend to hang by returning

         - Fixed current_server_version() to work with async backends

0.53    2012-04-14

          either with as_json or async backends
        - Fixed bug in TestServer where it wasn't shutting down ES correctly
          if it failed to create a new ES.pm object

0.49    2012-02-17
        Don't pass a custom port param through to ElasticSearch::TestServer

        BREAKING CHANGE:
        Updated the bulk* methods to support index, type, timestamp and ttl
        args.  As a result, the method signatures have changed.

        ENHANCEMENTS:
         - index(), create() and the index/create bulk actions now accept
           a JSON encoded string as a value for the 'data' param.

         - Fixed a bug in index_stats and addded 'get' stats and groups.
         - Corrected spelling of 'quorom' to 'quorum'
         - create() now uses the index op_type instead of /_create to
           fix a bug when creating a doc without an ID
         - put_mapping wasn't respecting a type set with use_type()

0.47    2011-10-24

0.42    2011-08-26
        Dull Dist::Zilla change, for CPAN

0.41    2011-08-26

        BREAKING CHANGES:
         - ElasticSearch::Transport::Thrift is now in a separate release
         - delete_index() and delete_mapping() now require an index
           parameter, to avoid accidental deletes.
         - the return value for the bulk() methods, when { as_json => 1}
           is specified, is now the JSON equivalent of the normal
           return value, not the raw value from ES

        OTHER:
         - started using Dist::Zilla
         - Added ElasticSearch::Transport::Curl, as a separate release
         - get_aliases now works with {as_json => 1}

0.40    2011-08-10

        BREAKING CHANGE:
         - index_exists now returns an empty list if the index doesn't exist.
           Previously, it threw an error.

        OTHER:
         - Deprecated the use of top level mapping parameters in put_mapping()
           in favour of just using the 'mapping' param
         - IDs could not contain eg "/" before - now fixed with Any::URI::Escape
           ie (URI::Escape or URI::Escape::XS)
         - The 'servers' param to new() now defaults to localhost if not
           specified
         - The "scroll" param to scrolled_search() now defaults to '1m'
         - added search_from and search_size to mlt()
         - added analyze_wildcard and lowercase_expanded_terms to searchqs()
         - mget() now returns [] if no docs specified, instead of dieing
         - Made Test::More v 0.96 a dependency, and fixed the hashbang path
           in the example (thanks to AVAR)

0.39    2011-07-19
         - "type" is now optional for get() requests
         - added index_exists()
         - added mget()
         - added SearchBuilder integration for aliases

0.38    2011-07-03
        - Integrated ElasticSearch::SearchBuilder
        - Deprecated the use of query types as top level params to count()
          and delete_by_query() in favour of query or queryb
        - trace_calls() now also accepts a filehandle (thanks FERREIRA)
        - TestServer now supports ES_TRANSPORT=all

0.37    2011-05-01

        BREAKING CHANGES:
         -  ElasticSearch::ScrolledSearch

            $scrolled_search->next() now returns 1 result by default, instead
            of $size results, to make it easier to write:

                while (my $result = $scroll->next) {}

         - ElasticSearch::TestServer is now an object which subclasses
           ElasticSearch itself.  connect_to_server() has been removed.
           Also, the port parameter can be used to specify a custom start port
           when starting the test server, making it easier to run the
           test server while there is an existing ES server running.

0.36    2011-04-24
        Updated ElasticSearch.pm to work with ElasticSearch version 0.16.0

        New features:

           Disable the automatic discovery of live nodes, to work with
           remote clusters or proxied clusters

         - scrolled_search():
           Convenience iterator to wrap search/scroll requests

         - reindex():
           Utility to reindex data from one index to another, or one
           cluster to another

         - use_index()/use_type():
           Set default index/type parameters

         - searchqs():
           URI/query string search, (as opposed to search() which uses a
           request body)

         - New search_type's : 'scan' and 'count'

         - index_settings():
           Retrieve index settings

0.35    2011-04-07
        Added the 'dynamic_templates' option to put_mapping

0.34    2011-03-20

        Fixed the tests for scrolling - turns out sorting when scrolling works
        correctly. It was my tests which were bad.

0.33    2011-03-19
        Added the ElasticSearch::Transport::HTTPTiny backend

0.32    2011-03-19

          sorting when scrolling still broken on the server)
        - reindex_es.pl now also preserves the _parent and _routing fields

0.29    2011-03-15

                 data is in an acceptable form for passing to ES

         - ElasticSearch::TestServer
               - starts a test server for use by the test suite
               - factored out to make it easier for others to use

        Also:
         - create_index() now supports adding mappings at the same time
         - Added bulk_create(), bulk_index() and bulk_delete()
         - Bulk actions now accept _id and id etc, which means that

0.17    2010-08-01

        Supports ElasticSearch version 0.9, which removes support for some
        features of older versions.

      - In search() added support for 'script_fields'
      - In count() and delete_by_query() added support for 'custom_score',
        'fuzzy', 'span_term', 'span_first', 'span_near', 'span_not',
        'span_or'
      - Removed terms() - now handled by search facets
      - Added the 'full' parameter to flush_index()
      - Changed put_mapping() to automatically prefix the type properties
        definition with the type name

        the newly exposed GET _mapping API
      - Added current_server_version()
      - Added the 'filter_nodes', 'filter_metadata', 'filter_routing_table'
        and 'filter_indices' params to cluster_state()



0.16    2010-05-20
        Added an ElasticSearch::Error::Timeout error class, to catch
        occassions when the request times out, instead of failing
        for a different reason.

        Also, catch 'Server closed connection' errors, and automatically
        refresh_servers and retry the request.

0.15    2010-05-16
        Fixed a bug in refresh_servers() introduced in 0.14, when forking
        processes.

0.14    2010-05-16
        The object now stores the original servers parameter, so that
        if the nodes disassociate and the live server list is limited,
        the object can still try the original servers.

0.13    2010-05-13
        Added nodes_stats(), shutdown(), restart() and camel_case()
        Removed Alien::ElasticSearch, as it is now easier to install

        http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/8cfa04cea3bc2317ee613384ced4da20cf2737aa

      - Updated the API to take into account ElasticSearch's change from
        using camelCase to underscore_separators
      - create() now uses the /_create postfix instead of op_type=create,
        although that flag is still available through index() and set()
      - Changed more_like_this and more_like_this_field to mlt and mlt_field
      - Changed fuzzy_like_this and fuzzy_like_this_field to flt and flt_field
      - Changed term() to use gt/gte/lt/lte instead of from/to and
        fromInclusive/toInclusive
      - put_mapping now defaults to { ignore_conflicts => 0 }, so the
        default now is to complain
      - In mlt, boost_terms:boolean and boost_terms_factor:float have now
        been merged to boost_terms:float

0.06    2010-04-03
      - The test suite now requires Alien::ElasticSearch, and uses its own
        config file and work dir, so as not to interfere with existing

        in the terms() query
      - the filteredQuery clause renamed to 'filtered' as per a change in ES
